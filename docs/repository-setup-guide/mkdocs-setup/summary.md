# Mkdocs Setup


- [Local Setup](mkdocs-local-setup.md)
- [Github Pages Setup](gh-pages-setup.md)

We have implemented Mkdocs, a Python-based static site generator, as the documentation framework for our repository. Mkdocs allows us to create clean and professional-looking documentation sites from simple Markdown files.

To set up Mkdocs for our repository, we followed the following steps:

<b>Install Mkdocs:</b> We installed Mkdocs by using `pip`, the package installer for Python. This enabled us to access the Mkdocs command-line interface (CLI) and utilize its features.

<b>Configuration:</b> We created a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file in the root directory of our repository. This file serves as the central configuration point for our Mkdocs project. It allows us to specify various settings, such as the site name, theme, navigation structure, and additional customizations.

<b>Documentation Structure:</b> We organized our documentation content using Markdown files. Mkdocs automatically converts these Markdown files into HTML pages, making it easy to write and maintain our documentation.

<b>Customization:</b> Mkdocs provides a range of themes and customization options to tailor the appearance of our documentation site. We explored different themes and selected the one that best suited our needs. Additionally, we customized the theme to match our branding and improve the user experience.

<b>Preview and Local Development:</b> To view our documentation site during the development phase, we utilized the Mkdocs built-in development server. This allowed us to preview the site locally and make necessary adjustments before publishing it.

By implementing Mkdocs and following these steps, we have created a comprehensive and user-friendly documentation framework for our repository. It enables us to efficiently document our code, project guidelines, and other relevant information in a clear and organized manner.
